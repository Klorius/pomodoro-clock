# pomodoro-clock
Pomodoro clock to keep track of my working time and breaks

A simple setup with the ability to change the working time and break time. 
Should be mobil responsive at least on a Galaxy 5s.


ONLY CHANGES TO THE JS 

Things to do:
-Create a resume function within the start button, the time should start from the point at which the it was stopped
-disable the buttons with the class ="inputBtn" when the timer is running.
-create a reset button so that you dont need to reload the page.
-fix latency issue after start button is pressed, around 500ms-1s latency.
